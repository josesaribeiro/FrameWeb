# FrameWeb

The Framework-based Design Method for Web Engineering (FrameWeb) is a Web Engineering method that targets Web-based Information Systems (WIS) that use certain kinds of framework (Front Controller, Dependency Injection, Object/Relational Mapping, etc.) in their architectures.

The method was originally proposed by prof. [VÃ­tor E. Silva Souza](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~vitorsouza/en/academia/) during his Masters degree and has been evolving since 2015 through the work of his supervised students.

For more details about the project, see the [wiki](https://github.com/nemo-ufes/FrameWeb/wiki) or check out its publications at the [project page in NEMO's website](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~vitorsouza/en/academia/).
